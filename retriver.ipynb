However, asset values look stretched and there are growing concerns about future fiscal risks.\\n- Growth outlook: Global GDP is projected to slow from 3.3% in 2024 to 3.2% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026 as front-loading ends and higher tariffs and policy uncertainty dampen investment and trade. U.S. growth is expected to slow from 2.8% (2024) to 1.8% (2025) and 1.5% (2026); Euro area from 1.2% (2025) to 1.0% (2026); China from 4.9% (2025) to 4.4% (2026). \\n- Inflation is expected to decline overall in most G20 economies, with headline inflation falling from 3.4% (2025) to 2.9% (2026) and core inflation remaining around 2.6% (2025) and 2.5% (2026).\\n- Significant risks remain: further tariff increases, resurgence of inflationary pressures, heightened fiscal risks, and volatile cryptoassets could weigh on growth and stability.

Hours worked per employee have declined in countries like Japan, Canada, France, Spain, and the UK through mid-2025, indicating weaker work intensity.\\n\\n- Wages: Nominal wage growth is moderating as labor markets cool and inflation eases. However wage growth remains above inflation targets in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the euro area unless productivity improves. As a result, real wage growth has softened since late 2024 in several economies (including Japan, Italy, Canada, Spain, and the UK).\\n\\n- Unemployment: The OECD unemployment rate has trended lower from higher levels in earlier years, with current rates around historically low levels. Country-specific data show small month-to-month changes in unemployment, with some countries seeing modest declines and others small increases.\\n\\n- Inflation: Disinflation has leveled off in many economies. Goods inflation has risen again, while services inflation remains persistent, leading to divergent inflation trends across advanced economies. The share of items rising more than 2% year-over-year is up in the US, Canada, Brazil, and the UK, but down in the euro area, Australia, and India. Inflation dynamics also vary widely across emerging markets (Indonesia up; Argentina and Türkiye down; China deflation in August).\\n\\n- Food prices: Higher global food prices have contributed to rising goods inflation, with dairy and vegetable oil prices up since early 2024. Food inflation is particularly high in Japan due to rice, and there are pressures in other countries (South Africa, UK, Korea, Italy, Indonesia).
