Industrial production and trade were supported by front-loading  \\nahead of higher tariffs. Strong Al-related investment boosted outcomes in the United States and  \\nfiscal support in China outweighed the drag from trade headwinds and property market weakness.  \\n● US bilateral tariff rates have increased on almost all countries since May. The overall effective US  \\ntariff rate rose to an estimated 19.5% at the end of August, the highest rate since 1933.  \\nThe full effects of tariff increases have yet to be felt - with many changes being phased in over  \\ntime and companies initially absorbing some tariff increases through margins - but are becoming  \\nincreasingly visible in spending choices, labour markets and consumer prices.  \\nSigns of softening are appearing in labour markets, with rising unemployment rates and declining  \\njob openings as a share of the unemployed in some economies, including the United States.  \\n● Disinflation has levelled off in many economies, with rising food prices behind a resurgence of  \\ngoods inflation and services inflation generally remaining persistent.  \\n● Financial market conditions have eased in recent months in advanced and emerging-market  \\neconomies, with buoyant asset prices, improving credit provision and low corporate bond spreads.  \\nNonetheless, asset values appear stretched and there is growing concern about future fiscal risks.  \\nGlobal GDP growth is projected to decrease from 3.3% in 2024, to 3.2% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026,  \\nas front-loading ceases and higher tariff rates and still-high policy uncertainty dampen investment  \\nand trade.  \\nAnnual GDP growth in the United States is projected to fall from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.8% in 2025 and  \\n1.5% in 2026, as strong investment growth in high technology sectors is more than offset by higher  \\ntariff rates and a drop in net immigration. Euro area GDP growth is expected to be 1.2% in 2025  \\nand 1.0% in 2026, with increased trade frictions and geopolitical uncertainty somewhat offset by  \\neasier credit conditions. Growth in China is projected to be 4.9% in 2025 and 4.4% in 2026, as  \\nfront-loading unwinds, higher tariffs take effect and fiscal support fades.  \\nInflation is projected to decline in most G20 economies as economic growth moderates and labour  \\nmarket pressures ease. Headline inflation is projected to fall from 3.4% in 2025 to 2.9% in 2026 in  \\nthe G20 economies, with core inflation in the G20 advanced economies remaining broadly stable  \\nat 2.6% in 2025 and 2.5% in 2026.  \\nSignificant risks to the economic outlook remain. Further increases in bilateral tariff rates, a  \\nresurgence of inflationary pressures, increased concern about fiscal risks, or substantial risk  \\nrepricing in financial markets could all lower economic growth relative to the baseline. High and  \\nvolatile crypto-asset valuations also raise financial stability risks given growing interconnectedness  \\nwith the traditional financial system. On the upside, reductions in trade restrictions or faster  \\ndevelopment and adoption of artificial intelligence technologies could strengthen growth prospects.\\n\\nFINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES Ⓒ OECD 2025'),\n",

Provided inflation expectations remain well anchored, policy interest rate reductions  \\nshould continue in economies in which underlying inflation is projected to moderate towards target.  \\nMaintaining central bank independence will preserve policy credibility and reduce the volatility and  \\npersistence of inflation.  \\n· Effective monitoring, supervision, and robust regulatory policies are needed to address financial  \\nstability risks.  \\n● Fiscal discipline is needed to safeguard longer-term debt sustainability and maintain space to react  \\nto future shocks. Credible medium-term budgetary adjustment paths with stronger efforts to contain  \\nand reallocate spending and enhance revenues are key to ensuring debt burdens stabilise.  \\n· Enhanced structural reform efforts are needed to durably improve living standards and help realise  \\nthe potential gains from new technologies such as artificial intelligence.\\n\\nTable 1.

Global economic growth proved more resilient than anticipated in the first half of 2025, with the  \\nworld economy expanding at an annualised pace of 3.2%. The front-loading of goods production and trade  \\nahead of the introduction of higher US tariff rates was an important source of support, with industrial  \\nproduction growth in the first half of the year exceeding the average pace of 2024 in most G20 economies.  \\nStrong investment growth in high technology sectors also boosted activity in the United States and Japan.  \\nNonetheless, private consumption growth has weakened in the United States, as well as in some euro  \\narea countries such as France and Italy. Many emerging-market economies had upside growth surprises  \\nbut in some cases this reflected idiosyncratic factors that are not expected to continue, including a first  \\nquarter spike in agriculture production in Brazil, and in the second quarter a steep fall in the growth of the  \\nGDP deflator in India, significant stockbuilding in T�rkiye, and a marked rebound in investment in  \\nIndonesia. In China, growth has held up, with a pick-up in the pace of government spending more than  \\noffsetting the dampening influence of the ongoing property market adjustment and headwinds to trade with  \\nthe United States.\\n\\nFINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES ⓒ OECD 2025'),\n",

Additional increases in US bilateral tariff rates on almost all trading partners since mid-May have  \\nraised the (ex-ante) effective tariff rate on US merchandise imports to an estimated 19.5% as of end-August  \\n(using 2024-based weights) (Figure 4, Panel A). This is the highest tariff rate since 1933 and  \\n4.1 percentage points higher than the rate in mid-May (used in the June OECD Economic Outlook). At the  \\nsectoral level, US tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports have been raised by an additional  \\n25 percentage points and tariffs on all copper imports by 50 percentage points. New bilateral agreements  \\ncovering tariffs, investment and other areas of cooperation have been concluded with some countries  \\nsince May, including the European Union, Japan and Indonesia, reducing the tariff rates being applied on  \\nsome items. Amongst the G20, China, India and Brazil face the highest increases in bilateral US tariff rates  \\nthis year. Ongoing legal challenges and negotiations, and the risk of new tariffs on currently-exempt items,  \\nadd to uncertainty about trade policies. Newspaper-based measures of trade policy uncertainty have  \\nmoderated since April 2025, but remain high by historical standards.\\n\\n  \\n\\n5. The impacts of higher tariff rates are yet to be fully felt in the US economy. This reflects a  \\ncombination of factors, with firms making use of inventories and ample profit margins to avoid or absorb  \\nthe initial impact of higher tariffs, lags between the announcement and imposition of higher tariff rates, and  \\nthe exemption of goods already in transit from higher tariff rates. At the margins, there are also some signs  \\nof reduced purchases of goods subject to higher tariff increases (Figure 4, Panel D). Observed (ex-post)  \\nmonthly tariff rates calculated from United States revenue and trade statistics (reported customs duties  \\ndivided by the value of merchandise imports) have risen sharply this year, but lag estimated effective tariff  \\nrates (Figure 4, Panel B), portending an increase in tariff collection in the coming months.\\n\\n  \\n\\n6. There are already some signs that tariffs have begun to be passed through into consumer prices,  \\nnotably durable goods with a high import content (Figure 4, Panel C).

Equity valuations have been buoyant, with stock prices rising substantially in most countries, and  \\nthe market capitalisation of crypto-assets has continued to surge.

In advanced G20 economies, aggregate economic growth is projected to moderate. Growth is  \\nexpected to slow in the United States as higher effective tariff rates further come into effect and policy  \\nuncertainty remains elevated. A drop in net immigration and reductions in the federal workforce are also  \\nanticipated to soften economic growth. However, these factors will be somewhat offset by the strong  \\nmomentum of business investment in high technology sectors, fiscal support and assumed further  \\nmonetary policy easing. Annual GDP growth is projected to slow from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.8% in 2025 and  \\n1.5% in 2026. In Canada, growth is projected to remain modest, at 1.1% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026, given  \\ngreater trade restrictions on exports to the United States.\\n\\n  \\n\\n15. In European economies, increased trade frictions and geopolitical uncertainty are expected to be  \\nsomewhat offset by easier credit conditions, with growth in the euro area projected to be 1.2% in 2025 and  \\n1.0% in 2026. Fiscal expansion is expected to boost economic activity in Germany, but expected  \\nconsolidation in both France and Italy will dampen growth. In the United Kingdom, a tighter fiscal stance,  \\nhigher trade costs and uncertainty are also anticipated to drag on external and domestic demand, with  \\ngrowth projected to ease from 1.4% in 2025 to 1.0% in 2026. In Japan, robust corporate profits and strong  \\ninvestment growth should be a tailwind to economic activity this year, with growth projected to be 1.1% in  \\n2025 before slowing to 0.5% in 2026. The recent rebound in Korea is projected to continue, with annual  \\ngrowth picking up from 1.0% in 2025 to 2.2% in 2026.\\n\\n  \\n\\n16. Economic growth in the emerging-market G20 economies is projected to ease over the coming  \\nyears. In China, the unwinding of front-loading of exports, the imposition of higher tariff rates on imports  \\nand the fading of fiscal support is expected to lower growth, beginning in the second half of this year.  \\nChinese real GDP growth is projected to be 4.9% in 2025 and 4.4% in 2026. One-off factors behind recent  \\neconomic strength in Brazil, Türkiye and South Africa are expected to unwind through the second half of  \\nthis year before growth stabilises. In Brazil, growth is expected to be 2.3% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026,  \\nTürkiye is projected to grow by 3.2% in both 2025 and 2026 and South Africa is projected to grow by 1.1%  \\nin 2025 and 1.3% in 2026. In India, higher tariff rates will weigh on the export sector, but overall activity is  \\nanticipated to be supported by monetary and fiscal policy easing, including the reform to the Goods and  \\nServices Tax, with growth projected to be 6.7% in 2025 and 6.2% in 2026. Similarly, further monetary  \\npolicy easing and strong public investment are expected to support the Indonesian economy, with annual  \\ngrowth of 4.9% projected for both 2025 and 2026.\\n\\n  \\n\\n17. Aggregate consumer price inflation for the G20 countries is expected to decline as economic  \\ngrowth and labour markets ease (Figure 8, Panel B). In the United States, the increase in effective tariff  \\nrates will further boost inflation, with the rate of pass-through to final goods prices assumed to strengthen  \\nas businesses become less willing to absorb the rising cost of imported goods. As a result, US annual  \\ninflation is projected to remain above target throughout 2026. In the euro area, inflation is anticipated to  \\nremain subdued, while the normalisation of food prices in Japan will contribute to inflation moving back to  \\nthe central bank target in 2026. Overall, headline inflation in the G20 advanced economies is projected to  \\nbe 2.5% in both 2025 and 2026, while core inflation is also anticipated to remain broadly stable at 2.6% in  \\n2025 and 2.5% in 2026. In the G20 emerging-market economies, inflation is projected to decline more  \\nnoticeably, with headline inflation of 4.1% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026. Significant further disinflation in  \\nArgentina and Türkiye are key factors, but inflation is also anticipated to moderate in Brazil and Mexico. In  \\ncontrast, a rise in inflation is projected for Indonesia, as past exchange rate depreciation feeds into  \\ndomestic prices. In China, inflation is expected to gradually increase from its current very low level, partly  \\nreflecting the imposition of higher tariff rates on goods imported from the United States.\\n\\nFINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES © OECD 2025'),\n",

Substantial risks remain around the baseline projections. Amid ongoing policy uncertainty, a key  \\nconcern is that bilateral tariff rates could be raised further on merchandise imports. This could arise through  \\nthe application of recent tariff rate increases in the United States and China to a broader range of goods,  \\nincluding pharmaceuticals and semi-conductors. Higher trade barriers could also be adopted in other  \\neconomies to protect domestic industry against enhanced low-price competition, especially in the event  \\nthat trade is diverted. In addition to the direct effects through raising costs and final goods prices, such  \\nchanges could raise policy uncertainty further, with adverse impacts on investment and consumer  \\nconfidence. The associated restructuring of production and supply chains might also result in additional  \\ncosts that would feed through into prices and dampen growth. On the upside, any agreements that lower  \\nbilateral tariff barriers from current levels and improve confidence would support stronger economic growth  \\nand trade and lower inflation relative to the baseline.\\n\\n  \\n\\n19. Inflation could be higher than currently projected. Food price inflation could continue to move  \\nhigher and any additional increase in geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions could threaten global  \\nenergy supply, pushing up energy prices. Given the salience of food and energy prices for household  \\nconsumption baskets, higher price rises for these items could raise short-term inflation expectations and  \\nresult in policy interest rates being higher than would otherwise have been the case. Such a scenario could  \\nalso adversely affect consumer confidence, further weakening growth. An additional concern, particularly  \\nin the United States, is that the pass-through of tariffs into prices could strengthen more quickly than  \\nanticipated once companies exhaust the scope to absorb higher costs in their profit margins. This may  \\nincrease the risk of second-round effects and greater inflation persistence.\\n\\n  \\n\\n20. Fiscal vulnerabilities could increasingly attract attention, tightening financial conditions and adversely  \\nimpacting growth prospects. Rising long-term sovereign bond yields reflect large and persisting fiscal deficits  \\ncombined with historically high levels of public debt in many economies.

Potential financial stability risks have intensified given the stretched valuations apparent in several  \\nasset markets. Weaker-than-expected growth or upside inflation surprises could trigger widespread risk  \\nrepricing in financial markets and a resurgence in volatility. Equities are richly valued in many major  \\neconomies, based on equity price-to-earnings ratios, with persistently robust earnings growth needed to  \\njustify current prices. Rising equity prices have been especially evident for technology stocks (Figure 9,  \\nPanel A), increasing the concentration of equity indexes in the technology sector. High concentration  \\nexacerbates the potential impact of idiosyncratic firm or sector-specific shocks on aggregate equity  \\nmarkets, with potential spillovers to leveraged investment funds that trigger large margin calls and  \\ndeleveraging through forced sales. The rapid expansion of non-bank financial intermediaries, often in  \\nopaque and fragmented private finance markets that rely on banks for liquidity, also raises spillover risks.  \\nOn the upside, stronger defence spending or stronger investment and productivity growth due to new  \\ntechnologies, such as artificial intelligence, could boost economic growth by more than projected,  \\nimproving living standards and supporting asset valuations.\\n\\nFigure 9.

Countries need to find ways of engaging co-operatively within the global trading system and  \\nworking together to make trade policy more predictable. Agreements to ease trade tensions and lower  \\nexisting trade barriers, and clear and transparent trade policies, would improve policy certainty and  \\nstrengthen the prospects for investment and growth. Steps to lower tariffs and non-tariff barriers, deepen  \\ntrade agreements or reduce barriers to trade in services would also benefit productivity and living  \\nstandards. Efforts to prevent further trade fragmentation should be coupled with reforms that enhance  \\nsecurity and strengthen the resilience of supply chains, including by encouraging firms to diversify both  \\nsuppliers and buyers and by agreements between countries that align regulatory standards on key  \\nintermediate production inputs. This would help to balance economic security needs with continued growth  \\nwhile preserving open markets.\\n\\nMonetary policy should remain vigilant\\n======================================\\n\\n24. Policy interest rates have been lowered recently by many major central banks. Amongst the  \\nadvanced economies, both the United States and Canada reduced policy rates in September, with  \\nconcerns about downside risks in labour markets outweighing the risk of upside inflationary pressures from  \\ntariff increases. In contrast, policy rates have remained unchanged in Japan since January, and in the euro  \\narea since June given area-wide inflation close to target and policy rates close to neutral. Policy rates have  \\nbeen reduced in many major emerging market economies given contained inflation pressures, recent  \\ncurrency appreciation against the US dollar, and adverse demand shocks from higher US trade costs and  \\nelevated uncertainty. Brazil is an exception, with the policy rate having been raised further to ensure that  \\ninflation expectations remain well-anchored. Central bank balance sheet reductions have also continued  \\nin many countries, but the pace has moderated in some, including the United States and the United  \\nKingdom.\\n\\n  \\n\\n25. Central banks need to remain vigilant and attentive to shifts in the balance of risks around  \\neconomic developments and financial markets in order to maintain price stability. Provided inflation  \\nexpectations remain well anchored, policy rate reductions should continue in economies in which  \\nunderlying inflation is projected to moderate towards target (Figure 10). The ability and incentives of  \\npolicymakers to react quickly and credibly to shifts in the risks to price stability are enhanced by central  \\nbank independence, both legal and operational, and accountability. These lower the volatility and  \\npersistence of inflation by helping to ensure that long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.\\n\\n  \\n\\n26. In the United States, policy rates are projected to decline further over the coming year as labour  \\nmarket pressures ease, provided the ongoing rise in the relative price of tradeable goods from higher tariffs  \\ndoes not trigger broader inflation pressures. A gradual easing of policy rates is also expected in Australia,  \\nCanada and the United Kingdom. In the euro area, where policy rates are already close to neutral levels,  \\nthe policy stance is expected to remain unchanged. Policy rates are projected to increase in Japan as  \\nmonetary policy accommodation continues to be gradually withdrawn. Amongst the emerging-market  \\neconomies, policy rates are expected to decline in Brazil, Mexico and Türkiye, as inflation pressures  \\nmoderate, but remain broadly unchanged in most other economies. In China, the policy stance is expected  \\nto remain accommodative given the underlying softness of inflation.\\n\\nFINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES © OECD 2025'),\n",

Stretched valuations in financial markets, including the rapid growth in crypto-asset market  \\ncapitalisation, and the growing interconnections between banks and non-bank financial institutions call for  \\nenhanced vigilance to safeguard financial stability. Effective monitoring, supervision and robust regulatory  \\npolicies are needed, particularly of potential liquidity mismatches and leverage risks for non-bank financial  \\ninstitutions, in line with internationally-recommended norms. Enhancing reporting requirements and filling  \\ndata gaps would improve the monitoring of risks and help relevant authorities mitigate financial  \\nvulnerabilities and prepare for possible future corrections in asset prices that would have systemic  \\nconsequences. While crypto-assets share some characteristics with traditional financial products, they  \\npresent a unique set of policy challenges given their borderless and pseudonymous nature. Countries  \\nshould continue efforts to develop and update regulations related to crypto assets. Tailored regulatory  \\napproaches are warranted while ensuring regulations maintain technological neutrality to avoid creating  \\nan uneven playing field. While flexibility for jurisdictions to implement domestic regulatory approaches is  \\noften required, international regulatory cooperation is key given the ease with which crypto-assets move  \\nacross borders.\\n\\nCredible and well-designed budgetary measures are needed to safeguard public debt  \\nsustainability\\n\\n  \\n\\n28.

Many countries have persisting budget deficits, and debt service costs are rising as low-yielding  \\ndebt matures and is replaced by costlier new issuance. Difficult budgetary choices are increasingly being  \\nfelt as new near-term demands, such as rising defence spending, augment the impending fiscal pressures  \\nfrom ageing populations and climate change. Significant spending challenges in many emerging-market  \\neconomies also stem from the need to enhance physical and digital infrastructure and strengthen existing  \\nsocial safety nets at a time of high debt, particularly in lower-income countries.\\n\\n  \\n\\n29.

Systematic and regular spending reviews, strengthened public procurement practices, and  \\nenhanced use of digital technologies could all help to improve public sector efficiency and allow resources  \\nto be reallocated efficiently as priorities shift. Improved targeting and reforms to enhance working lives  \\nwould also help to contain public expenditure. Broader tax bases, elimination of inefficient tax expenditures,  \\nand shifting tax systems over time towards less-distortive taxes with fewer exemptions would help to  \\nmobilise additional revenue and make the tax system more growth-friendly. Enhanced tax compliance and  \\ncollection, and reforms to reduce informality are also key priorities in many emerging-market economies.  \\nStrong fiscal institutions, including clear and well-designed fiscal rules and independent fiscal councils, can  \\nimprove the credibility and transparency of budgetary policies and policy choices, and thereby contain  \\nfinancing costs.\\n\\nStronger structural reform efforts would improve living standards\\n\\n31. At a time of limited fiscal capacity in many economies, structural policy reforms can help mitigate  \\nthe medium and long-term headwinds facing economic growth. New estimates from the OECD Long-Term  \\nModel project that global potential output growth will slow markedly over the coming decades, largely due  \\nto demographic factors and the consequences of a sustained period of weak capital investment for  \\nproductivity. From around 3% in 2025, global annual potential output growth is projected to moderate to  \\n2¾ per cent in the first part of the 2030s and 2¼ per cent in the early 2040s. The slowdown is almost  \\nentirely accounted for by developments in the emerging-market economies, including their gradual  \\nconvergence with higher-income economies. While potential output growth in the G20 advanced  \\neconomies is projected to fall from an already-low annual rate of 1½ per cent to 1¼ per cent between 2025  \\nand 2050, annual growth in the G20 emerging-market economies is projected to fall from 4¼ per cent to  \\n1½ per cent over the same period. However, growth prospects could be stronger if all countries enhanced  \\ntheir efforts to implement a broad range of structural reforms and new technologies, such as artificial  \\nintelligence, were to be adopted rapidly.\\n\\n  \\n\\n32. Recent editions of the OECD Economic Outlook have highlighted key factors behind the ongoing  \\nslowdown in global growth, including a sustained period of weak investment and productivity growth, and  \\nrising labour shortages. Policy reforms that enhance competitive dynamics in product markets, mitigate  \\nlabour shortages and improve economic governance could all help to overcome these. For example,  \\nreducing regulatory barriers to firm entry and growth could improve product market competition and  \\nincentives to innovate and invest. Skill shortages could be helped by policy reforms that raise employment  \\nand participation rates, particularly of women, such as lower income tax wedges for second earners or  \\nintroducing more balanced parental leave arrangements. Estimates using the OECD Long-Term Model  \\nhighlight that a package of reforms that involves reducing product market regulation, raising female  \\nemployment rates and improving the rule of law could boost average annual real GDP growth by  \\n0.2 percentage points in the advanced G20 economies over the period to 2050 and 0.8 percentage points  \\nin emerging-market G20 economies (Figure 11, Panels A and B). The estimated gains differ by country,  \\nwith many emerging-market economies experiencing the largest cumulative boost to output and living  \\nstandards by 2050 (Figure 11, Panel C).\\n\\n  \\n\\n33. The development and diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is already well underway,  \\nand will be a key source of new economic opportunities. Significant uncertainty remains about the speed  \\nof AI adoption, and hence the impact on future productivity and growth developments, with adoption  \\ndependent on existing endowments of labour and skills, investment, industry composition, and a range of  \\ndomestic government policies. Structural reforms, including the measures set out above, could promote  \\nstronger AI uptake. Pro-competition reforms could sharpen the incentives for AI adoption and reduce the  \\ncapacity for successful AI firms to build and exploit monopoly positions.

Provided inflation expectations remain well anchored, policy interest rate reductions  \\nshould continue in economies in which underlying inflation is projected to moderate towards target.  \\nMaintaining central bank independence will preserve policy credibility and reduce the volatility and  \\npersistence of inflation.  \\n· Effective monitoring, supervision, and robust regulatory policies are needed to address financial  \\nstability risks.  \\n● Fiscal discipline is needed to safeguard longer-term debt sustainability and maintain space to react  \\nto future shocks. Credible medium-term budgetary adjustment paths with stronger efforts to contain  \\nand reallocate spending and enhance revenues are key to ensuring debt burdens stabilise.  \\n· Enhanced structural reform efforts are needed to durably improve living standards and help realise  \\nthe potential gains from new technologies such as artificial intelligence.\\n\\nTable 1.

Global growth has remained resilient but is expected to moderate in 2026.”\\n- The image shows a table with projections for 2024, 2025, and 2026, plus the differences from the June OECD Economic Outlook (EO) for 2025 and 2026.\\n- Columns (rough structure): 2024 value; 2025 interim EO projection; 2025 vs June EO difference; 2026 interim EO projection; 2026 vs June EO difference.\\n- Aggregates and countries listed include: World, G20, Australia, Canada, Euro area (and sub-country: Germany, France, Italy, Spain), Japan, Korea, Mexico, Türkiye, United Kingdom, United States, Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa.\\n- Example data points (illustrative):\\n  - World: 2024 = 3.3; 2025 interim = 3.2; 2025 difference = 0.3; 2026 interim = 2.9; 2026 difference = 0.0.\\n  - United States: 2024 = 2.8; 2025 interim = 1.8; 2025 difference = 0.2; 2026 interim = 1.5; 2026 difference = 0.0.\\n  - China: 2024 = 5.0; 2025 interim = 4.9; 2025 difference = 0.2; 2026 interim = 4.4; 2026 difference = 0.1.\\n  - India: 2024 = 6.5; 2025 interim = 6.7; 2025 difference = 0.4; 2026 interim = 6.2; 2026 difference = −0.2.\\n  - Argentina: 2024 = −1.3; 2025 interim = 4.5; 2025 difference = −0.7; 2026 interim = 4.3; 2026 difference = 0.0.\\n  - Saudi Arabia: 2024 = 1.9; 2025 interim = 3.7; 2025 difference = 1.9; 2026 interim = 3.9; 2026 difference = 1.4.\\n- Notes and methodology:\\n  - The differences are relative to June 2025 EO (in percentage points) and are rounded.\\n  - World and G20 aggregates use moving nominal GDP weights at PPPs; PPP revisions affect aggregates.\\n  - Footnotes explain Spain’s status in the G20, Spain’s fiscal year, and other minor clarifications.\\n- Source and copyright: OECD Interim Economic Outlook 118 database and OECD Economic Outlook 117 database; © OECD 2025.\\n- The page header and footer indicate it is part of a wider OECD report on economic outlooks.\\n\\nIn short, the image combines a policy-recommendation summary with a detailed OECD table showing 2024 actuals and 2025–2026 projections (and revisions) for Global growth and for a wide set of countries.'}"

Adding structural reforms raises growth moderately (blue line), and adding faster AI adoption along with reforms yields the highest growth (green line), which peaks around 2030–2035 and remains above the other paths through 2050.\\n  - In emerging economies (Panel B), all paths start relatively high (around 4–5%), but the baseline declines more steeply toward the mid- to late-2040s. The reform scenario remains higher than baseline, and the combination of reforms plus faster AI adoption stays the highest throughout, though the gap narrows toward 2050.\\n- The legend and notes indicate the green path reflects structural reforms plus faster AI adoption; the blue path reflects structural reforms alone; and the red path is the business-as-usual baseline.\\n- Source context: these are OECD long-run scenario projections describing the impact of reforms and AI adoption on potential output, with the baseline from BAU1 (OECD 2025) and AI adoption assumptions based on the cited Filippucci et al. study.',\n",

Industrial production and trade were supported by front-loading  \\nahead of higher tariffs. Strong Al-related investment boosted outcomes in the United States and  \\nfiscal support in China outweighed the drag from trade headwinds and property market weakness.  \\n● US bilateral tariff rates have increased on almost all countries since May. The overall effective US  \\ntariff rate rose to an estimated 19.5% at the end of August, the highest rate since 1933.  \\nThe full effects of tariff increases have yet to be felt - with many changes being phased in over  \\ntime and companies initially absorbing some tariff increases through margins - but are becoming  \\nincreasingly visible in spending choices, labour markets and consumer prices.  \\nSigns of softening are appearing in labour markets, with rising unemployment rates and declining  \\njob openings as a share of the unemployed in some economies, including the United States.  \\n● Disinflation has levelled off in many economies, with rising food prices behind a resurgence of  \\ngoods inflation and services inflation generally remaining persistent.  \\n● Financial market conditions have eased in recent months in advanced and emerging-market  \\neconomies, with buoyant asset prices, improving credit provision and low corporate bond spreads.  \\nNonetheless, asset values appear stretched and there is growing concern about future fiscal risks.  \\nGlobal GDP growth is projected to decrease from 3.3% in 2024, to 3.2% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026,  \\nas front-loading ceases and higher tariff rates and still-high policy uncertainty dampen investment  \\nand trade.  \\nAnnual GDP growth in the United States is projected to fall from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.8% in 2025 and  \\n1.5% in 2026, as strong investment growth in high technology sectors is more than offset by higher  \\ntariff rates and a drop in net immigration. Euro area GDP growth is expected to be 1.2% in 2025  \\nand 1.0% in 2026, with increased trade frictions and geopolitical uncertainty somewhat offset by  \\neasier credit conditions. Growth in China is projected to be 4.9% in 2025 and 4.4% in 2026, as  \\nfront-loading unwinds, higher tariffs take effect and fiscal support fades.  \\nInflation is projected to decline in most G20 economies as economic growth moderates and labour  \\nmarket pressures ease. Headline inflation is projected to fall from 3.4% in 2025 to 2.9% in 2026 in  \\nthe G20 economies, with core inflation in the G20 advanced economies remaining broadly stable  \\nat 2.6% in 2025 and 2.5% in 2026.  \\nSignificant risks to the economic outlook remain. Further increases in bilateral tariff rates, a  \\nresurgence of inflationary pressures, increased concern about fiscal risks, or substantial risk  \\nrepricing in financial markets could all lower economic growth relative to the baseline. High and  \\nvolatile crypto-asset valuations also raise financial stability risks given growing interconnectedness  \\nwith the traditional financial system. On the upside, reductions in trade restrictions or faster  \\ndevelopment and adoption of artificial intelligence technologies could strengthen growth prospects.\\n\\nFINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES Ⓒ OECD 2025'},\n",

Provided inflation expectations remain well anchored, policy interest rate reductions  \\nshould continue in economies in which underlying inflation is projected to moderate towards target.  \\nMaintaining central bank independence will preserve policy credibility and reduce the volatility and  \\npersistence of inflation.  \\n· Effective monitoring, supervision, and robust regulatory policies are needed to address financial  \\nstability risks.  \\n● Fiscal discipline is needed to safeguard longer-term debt sustainability and maintain space to react  \\nto future shocks. Credible medium-term budgetary adjustment paths with stronger efforts to contain  \\nand reallocate spending and enhance revenues are key to ensuring debt burdens stabilise.  \\n· Enhanced structural reform efforts are needed to durably improve living standards and help realise  \\nthe potential gains from new technologies such as artificial intelligence.\\n\\nTable 1.

Global economic growth proved more resilient than anticipated in the first half of 2025, with the  \\nworld economy expanding at an annualised pace of 3.2%. The front-loading of goods production and trade  \\nahead of the introduction of higher US tariff rates was an important source of support, with industrial  \\nproduction growth in the first half of the year exceeding the average pace of 2024 in most G20 economies.  \\nStrong investment growth in high technology sectors also boosted activity in the United States and Japan.  \\nNonetheless, private consumption growth has weakened in the United States, as well as in some euro  \\narea countries such as France and Italy. Many emerging-market economies had upside growth surprises  \\nbut in some cases this reflected idiosyncratic factors that are not expected to continue, including a first  \\nquarter spike in agriculture production in Brazil, and in the second quarter a steep fall in the growth of the  \\nGDP deflator in India, significant stockbuilding in T�rkiye, and a marked rebound in investment in  \\nIndonesia. In China, growth has held up, with a pick-up in the pace of government spending more than  \\noffsetting the dampening influence of the ongoing property market adjustment and headwinds to trade with  \\nthe United States.\\n\\nFINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES ⓒ OECD 2025'},\n",

Global merchandise trade grew rapidly in the first half of 2025, partly influenced by the spike in  \\ngoods shipments to the United States. This was particularly evident prior to April (Figure 2, Panel A) and  \\nwas accompanied by a rise in inventory-to-sales ratios at US retailers. Trade continued to expand steadily  \\nin advanced Asian economies in the second quarter, as well as in emerging-market economies in both  \\nAsia and Eastern Europe, but import volumes declined sharply in the United States and exports dropped  \\nin Canada and Latin America. Bilateral trade between China and the United States has declined sharply  \\nin recent months (Figure 2, Panel B). Recent high-frequency global trade indicators have been mixed, with  \\nsigns that container port traffic, air freight and passenger traffic have all moderated over the summer.  \\nBusiness survey indicators of new export orders also remain comparatively soft.\\n\\nFigure 2.

Growth is  \\nexpected to slow in the United States as higher effective tariff rates further come into effect and policy  \\nuncertainty remains elevated. A drop in net immigration and reductions in the federal workforce are also  \\nanticipated to soften economic growth. However, these factors will be somewhat offset by the strong  \\nmomentum of business investment in high technology sectors, fiscal support and assumed further  \\nmonetary policy easing. Annual GDP growth is projected to slow from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.8% in 2025 and  \\n1.5% in 2026. In Canada, growth is projected to remain modest, at 1.1% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026, given  \\ngreater trade restrictions on exports to the United States.\\n\\n  \\n\\n15. In European economies, increased trade frictions and geopolitical uncertainty are expected to be  \\nsomewhat offset by easier credit conditions, with growth in the euro area projected to be 1.2% in 2025 and  \\n1.0% in 2026. Fiscal expansion is expected to boost economic activity in Germany, but expected  \\nconsolidation in both France and Italy will dampen growth. In the United Kingdom, a tighter fiscal stance,  \\nhigher trade costs and uncertainty are also anticipated to drag on external and domestic demand, with  \\ngrowth projected to ease from 1.4% in 2025 to 1.0% in 2026. In Japan, robust corporate profits and strong  \\ninvestment growth should be a tailwind to economic activity this year, with growth projected to be 1.1% in  \\n2025 before slowing to 0.5% in 2026. The recent rebound in Korea is projected to continue, with annual  \\ngrowth picking up from 1.0% in 2025 to 2.2% in 2026.\\n\\n  \\n\\n16. Economic growth in the emerging-market G20 economies is projected to ease over the coming  \\nyears. In China, the unwinding of front-loading of exports, the imposition of higher tariff rates on imports  \\nand the fading of fiscal support is expected to lower growth, beginning in the second half of this year.  \\nChinese real GDP growth is projected to be 4.9% in 2025 and 4.4% in 2026. One-off factors behind recent  \\neconomic strength in Brazil, Türkiye and South Africa are expected to unwind through the second half of  \\nthis year before growth stabilises. In Brazil, growth is expected to be 2.3% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026,  \\nTürkiye is projected to grow by 3.2% in both 2025 and 2026 and South Africa is projected to grow by 1.1%  \\nin 2025 and 1.3% in 2026. In India, higher tariff rates will weigh on the export sector, but overall activity is  \\nanticipated to be supported by monetary and fiscal policy easing, including the reform to the Goods and  \\nServices Tax, with growth projected to be 6.7% in 2025 and 6.2% in 2026. Similarly, further monetary  \\npolicy easing and strong public investment are expected to support the Indonesian economy, with annual  \\ngrowth of 4.9% projected for both 2025 and 2026.\\n\\n  \\n\\n17. Aggregate consumer price inflation for the G20 countries is expected to decline as economic  \\ngrowth and labour markets ease (Figure 8, Panel B). In the United States, the increase in effective tariff  \\nrates will further boost inflation, with the rate of pass-through to final goods prices assumed to strengthen  \\nas businesses become less willing to absorb the rising cost of imported goods. As a result, US annual  \\ninflation is projected to remain above target throughout 2026. In the euro area, inflation is anticipated to  \\nremain subdued, while the normalisation of food prices in Japan will contribute to inflation moving back to  \\nthe central bank target in 2026. Overall, headline inflation in the G20 advanced economies is projected to  \\nbe 2.5% in both 2025 and 2026, while core inflation is also anticipated to remain broadly stable at 2.6% in  \\n2025 and 2.5% in 2026. In the G20 emerging-market economies, inflation is projected to decline more  \\nnoticeably, with headline inflation of 4.1% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026. Significant further disinflation in  \\nArgentina and Türkiye are key factors, but inflation is also anticipated to moderate in Brazil and Mexico. In  \\ncontrast, a rise in inflation is projected for Indonesia, as past exchange rate depreciation feeds into  \\ndomestic prices. In China, inflation is expected to gradually increase from its current very low level, partly  \\nreflecting the imposition of higher tariff rates on goods imported from the United States.\\n\\nFINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES © OECD 2025'},\n",

Substantial risks remain around the baseline projections. Amid ongoing policy uncertainty, a key  \\nconcern is that bilateral tariff rates could be raised further on merchandise imports. This could arise through  \\nthe application of recent tariff rate increases in the United States and China to a broader range of goods,  \\nincluding pharmaceuticals and semi-conductors. Higher trade barriers could also be adopted in other  \\neconomies to protect domestic industry against enhanced low-price competition, especially in the event  \\nthat trade is diverted. In addition to the direct effects through raising costs and final goods prices, such  \\nchanges could raise policy uncertainty further, with adverse impacts on investment and consumer  \\nconfidence. The associated restructuring of production and supply chains might also result in additional  \\ncosts that would feed through into prices and dampen growth. On the upside, any agreements that lower  \\nbilateral tariff barriers from current levels and improve confidence would support stronger economic growth  \\nand trade and lower inflation relative to the baseline.\\n\\n  \\n\\n19. Inflation could be higher than currently projected. Food price inflation could continue to move  \\nhigher and any additional increase in geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions could threaten global  \\nenergy supply, pushing up energy prices. Given the salience of food and energy prices for household  \\nconsumption baskets, higher price rises for these items could raise short-term inflation expectations and  \\nresult in policy interest rates being higher than would otherwise have been the case. Such a scenario could  \\nalso adversely affect consumer confidence, further weakening growth. An additional concern, particularly  \\nin the United States, is that the pass-through of tariffs into prices could strengthen more quickly than  \\nanticipated once companies exhaust the scope to absorb higher costs in their profit margins. This may  \\nincrease the risk of second-round effects and greater inflation persistence.\\n\\n  \\n\\n20. Fiscal vulnerabilities could increasingly attract attention, tightening financial conditions and adversely  \\nimpacting growth prospects. Rising long-term sovereign bond yields reflect large and persisting fiscal deficits  \\ncombined with historically high levels of public debt in many economies. Further increases in term premia could  \\nheighten refinancing risks for some sovereign borrowers and may negatively feedback to parts of the financial  \\nsystem, including through the impact on the value of sovereign bond holdings. Ongoing vulnerabilities related  \\nto debt distress in emerging-market and developing economies also remain, especially for lower-income  \\ncountries who have had difficulty accessing markets or declining levels of foreign aid. The majority of emerging  \\nand developing economies have seen an increase in government debt as a share of GDP since 2019 and a  \\nsignificant share of their sovereign bonds are set to mature by the end of 2026.\\n\\nFINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES © OECD 2025'},\n",

Potential financial stability risks have intensified given the stretched valuations apparent in several  \\nasset markets. Weaker-than-expected growth or upside inflation surprises could trigger widespread risk  \\nrepricing in financial markets and a resurgence in volatility. Equities are richly valued in many major  \\neconomies, based on equity price-to-earnings ratios, with persistently robust earnings growth needed to  \\njustify current prices. Rising equity prices have been especially evident for technology stocks (Figure 9,  \\nPanel A), increasing the concentration of equity indexes in the technology sector. High concentration  \\nexacerbates the potential impact of idiosyncratic firm or sector-specific shocks on aggregate equity  \\nmarkets, with potential spillovers to leveraged investment funds that trigger large margin calls and  \\ndeleveraging through forced sales. The rapid expansion of non-bank financial intermediaries, often in  \\nopaque and fragmented private finance markets that rely on banks for liquidity, also raises spillover risks.  \\nOn the upside, stronger defence spending or stronger investment and productivity growth due to new  \\ntechnologies, such as artificial intelligence, could boost economic growth by more than projected,  \\nimproving living standards and supporting asset valuations.\\n\\nFigure 9.

Crypto-asset market capitalisation is around record  \\nhighs, totalling USD 3.9 trillion in September 2025, up from USD 830 billion in January 2023 (Figure 9,  \\nPanel B). However, crypto-asset values are highly volatile compared to other asset classes, such as  \\naggregate equity market indexes. The exposure of financial institutions to crypto-assets remains limited  \\nbut is increasing with the expansion of crypto exchange-traded products and recent regulatory  \\ndevelopments, particularly in the United States and the European Union. For instance, stablecoins – one  \\nspecific type of crypto-asset – are backed by traditional financial assets, such as sovereign bonds, and  \\nvaluation pressures could trigger destabilising runs with broader financial stability implications.\\n\\nFINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES © OECD 2025'},\n",

Countries need to find ways of engaging co-operatively within the global trading system and  \\nworking together to make trade policy more predictable. Agreements to ease trade tensions and lower  \\nexisting trade barriers, and clear and transparent trade policies, would improve policy certainty and  \\nstrengthen the prospects for investment and growth. Steps to lower tariffs and non-tariff barriers, deepen  \\ntrade agreements or reduce barriers to trade in services would also benefit productivity and living  \\nstandards. Efforts to prevent further trade fragmentation should be coupled with reforms that enhance  \\nsecurity and strengthen the resilience of supply chains, including by encouraging firms to diversify both  \\nsuppliers and buyers and by agreements between countries that align regulatory standards on key  \\nintermediate production inputs. This would help to balance economic security needs with continued growth  \\nwhile preserving open markets.\\n\\nMonetary policy should remain vigilant\\n======================================\\n\\n24. Policy interest rates have been lowered recently by many major central banks. Amongst the  \\nadvanced economies, both the United States and Canada reduced policy rates in September, with  \\nconcerns about downside risks in labour markets outweighing the risk of upside inflationary pressures from  \\ntariff increases. In contrast, policy rates have remained unchanged in Japan since January, and in the euro  \\narea since June given area-wide inflation close to target and policy rates close to neutral. Policy rates have  \\nbeen reduced in many major emerging market economies given contained inflation pressures, recent  \\ncurrency appreciation against the US dollar, and adverse demand shocks from higher US trade costs and  \\nelevated uncertainty. Brazil is an exception, with the policy rate having been raised further to ensure that  \\ninflation expectations remain well-anchored. Central bank balance sheet reductions have also continued  \\nin many countries, but the pace has moderated in some, including the United States and the United  \\nKingdom.\\n\\n  \\n\\n25. Central banks need to remain vigilant and attentive to shifts in the balance of risks around  \\neconomic developments and financial markets in order to maintain price stability. Provided inflation  \\nexpectations remain well anchored, policy rate reductions should continue in economies in which  \\nunderlying inflation is projected to moderate towards target (Figure 10). The ability and incentives of  \\npolicymakers to react quickly and credibly to shifts in the risks to price stability are enhanced by central  \\nbank independence, both legal and operational, and accountability. These lower the volatility and  \\npersistence of inflation by helping to ensure that long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.\\n\\n  \\n\\n26. In the United States, policy rates are projected to decline further over the coming year as labour  \\nmarket pressures ease, provided the ongoing rise in the relative price of tradeable goods from higher tariffs  \\ndoes not trigger broader inflation pressures. A gradual easing of policy rates is also expected in Australia,  \\nCanada and the United Kingdom. In the euro area, where policy rates are already close to neutral levels,  \\nthe policy stance is expected to remain unchanged. Policy rates are projected to increase in Japan as  \\nmonetary policy accommodation continues to be gradually withdrawn. Amongst the emerging-market  \\neconomies, policy rates are expected to decline in Brazil, Mexico and Türkiye, as inflation pressures  \\nmoderate, but remain broadly unchanged in most other economies. In China, the policy stance is expected  \\nto remain accommodative given the underlying softness of inflation.\\n\\nFINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES © OECD 2025'},\n",

Systematic and regular spending reviews, strengthened public procurement practices, and  \\nenhanced use of digital technologies could all help to improve public sector efficiency and allow resources  \\nto be reallocated efficiently as priorities shift. Improved targeting and reforms to enhance working lives  \\nwould also help to contain public expenditure. Broader tax bases, elimination of inefficient tax expenditures,  \\nand shifting tax systems over time towards less-distortive taxes with fewer exemptions would help to  \\nmobilise additional revenue and make the tax system more growth-friendly. Enhanced tax compliance and  \\ncollection, and reforms to reduce informality are also key priorities in many emerging-market economies.  \\nStrong fiscal institutions, including clear and well-designed fiscal rules and independent fiscal councils, can  \\nimprove the credibility and transparency of budgetary policies and policy choices, and thereby contain  \\nfinancing costs.\\n\\nStronger structural reform efforts would improve living standards\\n\\n31. At a time of limited fiscal capacity in many economies, structural policy reforms can help mitigate  \\nthe medium and long-term headwinds facing economic growth. New estimates from the OECD Long-Term  \\nModel project that global potential output growth will slow markedly over the coming decades, largely due  \\nto demographic factors and the consequences of a sustained period of weak capital investment for  \\nproductivity. From around 3% in 2025, global annual potential output growth is projected to moderate to  \\n2¾ per cent in the first part of the 2030s and 2¼ per cent in the early 2040s. The slowdown is almost  \\nentirely accounted for by developments in the emerging-market economies, including their gradual  \\nconvergence with higher-income economies. While potential output growth in the G20 advanced  \\neconomies is projected to fall from an already-low annual rate of 1½ per cent to 1¼ per cent between 2025  \\nand 2050, annual growth in the G20 emerging-market economies is projected to fall from 4¼ per cent to  \\n1½ per cent over the same period. However, growth prospects could be stronger if all countries enhanced  \\ntheir efforts to implement a broad range of structural reforms and new technologies, such as artificial  \\nintelligence, were to be adopted rapidly.\\n\\n  \\n\\n32. Recent editions of the OECD Economic Outlook have highlighted key factors behind the ongoing  \\nslowdown in global growth, including a sustained period of weak investment and productivity growth, and  \\nrising labour shortages. Policy reforms that enhance competitive dynamics in product markets, mitigate  \\nlabour shortages and improve economic governance could all help to overcome these. For example,  \\nreducing regulatory barriers to firm entry and growth could improve product market competition and  \\nincentives to innovate and invest. Skill shortages could be helped by policy reforms that raise employment  \\nand participation rates, particularly of women, such as lower income tax wedges for second earners or  \\nintroducing more balanced parental leave arrangements. Estimates using the OECD Long-Term Model  \\nhighlight that a package of reforms that involves reducing product market regulation, raising female  \\nemployment rates and improving the rule of law could boost average annual real GDP growth by  \\n0.2 percentage points in the advanced G20 economies over the period to 2050 and 0.8 percentage points  \\nin emerging-market G20 economies (Figure 11, Panels A and B). The estimated gains differ by country,  \\nwith many emerging-market economies experiencing the largest cumulative boost to output and living  \\nstandards by 2050 (Figure 11, Panel C).\\n\\n  \\n\\n33. The development and diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is already well underway,  \\nand will be a key source of new economic opportunities. Significant uncertainty remains about the speed  \\nof AI adoption, and hence the impact on future productivity and growth developments, with adoption  \\ndependent on existing endowments of labour and skills, investment, industry composition, and a range of  \\ndomestic government policies. Structural reforms, including the measures set out above, could promote  \\nstronger AI uptake. Pro-competition reforms could sharpen the incentives for AI adoption and reduce the  \\ncapacity for successful AI firms to build and exploit monopoly positions.

Industrial production and trade were supported by front-loading  \\nahead of higher tariffs. Strong Al-related investment boosted outcomes in the United States and  \\nfiscal support in China outweighed the drag from trade headwinds and property market weakness.  \\n● US bilateral tariff rates have increased on almost all countries since May. The overall effective US  \\ntariff rate rose to an estimated 19.5% at the end of August, the highest rate since 1933.  \\nThe full effects of tariff increases have yet to be felt - with many changes being phased in over  \\ntime and companies initially absorbing some tariff increases through margins - but are becoming  \\nincreasingly visible in spending choices, labour markets and consumer prices.  \\nSigns of softening are appearing in labour markets, with rising unemployment rates and declining  \\njob openings as a share of the unemployed in some economies, including the United States.  \\n● Disinflation has levelled off in many economies, with rising food prices behind a resurgence of  \\ngoods inflation and services inflation generally remaining persistent.  \\n● Financial market conditions have eased in recent months in advanced and emerging-market  \\neconomies, with buoyant asset prices, improving credit provision and low corporate bond spreads.  \\nNonetheless, asset values appear stretched and there is growing concern about future fiscal risks.  \\nGlobal GDP growth is projected to decrease from 3.3% in 2024, to 3.2% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026,  \\nas front-loading ceases and higher tariff rates and still-high policy uncertainty dampen investment  \\nand trade.  \\nAnnual GDP growth in the United States is projected to fall from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.8% in 2025 and  \\n1.5% in 2026, as strong investment growth in high technology sectors is more than offset by higher  \\ntariff rates and a drop in net immigration. Euro area GDP growth is expected to be 1.2% in 2025  \\nand 1.0% in 2026, with increased trade frictions and geopolitical uncertainty somewhat offset by  \\neasier credit conditions. Growth in China is projected to be 4.9% in 2025 and 4.4% in 2026, as  \\nfront-loading unwinds, higher tariffs take effect and fiscal support fades.  \\nInflation is projected to decline in most G20 economies as economic growth moderates and labour  \\nmarket pressures ease. Headline inflation is projected to fall from 3.4% in 2025 to 2.9% in 2026 in  \\nthe G20 economies, with core inflation in the G20 advanced economies remaining broadly stable  \\nat 2.6% in 2025 and 2.5% in 2026.  \\nSignificant risks to the economic outlook remain. Further increases in bilateral tariff rates, a  \\nresurgence of inflationary pressures, increased concern about fiscal risks, or substantial risk  \\nrepricing in financial markets could all lower economic growth relative to the baseline. High and  \\nvolatile crypto-asset valuations also raise financial stability risks given growing interconnectedness  \\nwith the traditional financial system. On the upside, reductions in trade restrictions or faster  \\ndevelopment and adoption of artificial intelligence technologies could strengthen growth prospects.\\n\\nFINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES Ⓒ OECD 2025')"

Hours worked per employee have declined in countries like Japan, Canada, France, Spain, and the UK through mid-2025, indicating weaker work intensity.\\n\\n- Wages: Nominal wage growth is moderating as labor markets cool and inflation eases. However wage growth remains above inflation targets in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the euro area unless productivity improves. As a result, real wage growth has softened since late 2024 in several economies (including Japan, Italy, Canada, Spain, and the UK).\\n\\n- Unemployment: The OECD unemployment rate has trended lower from higher levels in earlier years, with current rates around historically low levels. Country-specific data show small month-to-month changes in unemployment, with some countries seeing modest declines and others small increases.\\n\\n- Inflation: Disinflation has leveled off in many economies. Goods inflation has risen again, while services inflation remains persistent, leading to divergent inflation trends across advanced economies. The share of items rising more than 2% year-over-year is up in the US, Canada, Brazil, and the UK, but down in the euro area, Australia, and India. Inflation dynamics also vary widely across emerging markets (Indonesia up; Argentina and Türkiye down; China deflation in August).\\n\\n- Food prices: Higher global food prices have contributed to rising goods inflation, with dairy and vegetable oil prices up since early 2024. Food inflation is particularly high in Japan due to rice, and there are pressures in other countries (South Africa, UK, Korea, Italy, Indonesia).
