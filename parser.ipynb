Industrial production and trade were supported by front-loading  \\nahead of higher tariffs. Strong Al-related investment boosted outcomes in the United States and  \\nfiscal support in China outweighed the drag from trade headwinds and property market weakness.  \\n● US bilateral tariff rates have increased on almost all countries since May. The overall effective US  \\ntariff rate rose to an estimated 19.5% at the end of August, the highest rate since 1933.  \\nThe full effects of tariff increases have yet to be felt - with many changes being phased in over  \\ntime and companies initially absorbing some tariff increases through margins - but are becoming  \\nincreasingly visible in spending choices, labour markets and consumer prices.  \\nSigns of softening are appearing in labour markets, with rising unemployment rates and declining  \\njob openings as a share of the unemployed in some economies, including the United States.  \\n● Disinflation has levelled off in many economies, with rising food prices behind a resurgence of  \\ngoods inflation and services inflation generally remaining persistent.  \\n● Financial market conditions have eased in recent months in advanced and emerging-market  \\neconomies, with buoyant asset prices, improving credit provision and low corporate bond spreads.  \\nNonetheless, asset values appear stretched and there is growing concern about future fiscal risks.  \\nGlobal GDP growth is projected to decrease from 3.3% in 2024, to 3.2% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026,  \\nas front-loading ceases and higher tariff rates and still-high policy uncertainty dampen investment  \\nand trade.  \\nAnnual GDP growth in the United States is projected to fall from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.8% in 2025 and  \\n1.5% in 2026, as strong investment growth in high technology sectors is more than offset by higher  \\ntariff rates and a drop in net immigration. Euro area GDP growth is expected to be 1.2% in 2025  \\nand 1.0% in 2026, with increased trade frictions and geopolitical uncertainty somewhat offset by  \\neasier credit conditions. Growth in China is projected to be 4.9% in 2025 and 4.4% in 2026, as  \\nfront-loading unwinds, higher tariffs take effect and fiscal support fades.  \\nInflation is projected to decline in most G20 economies as economic growth moderates and labour  \\nmarket pressures ease. Headline inflation is projected to fall from 3.4% in 2025 to 2.9% in 2026 in  \\nthe G20 economies, with core inflation in the G20 advanced economies remaining broadly stable  \\nat 2.6% in 2025 and 2.5% in 2026.  \\nSignificant risks to the economic outlook remain.

Global economic growth proved more resilient than anticipated in the first half of 2025, with the  \\nworld economy expanding at an annualised pace of 3.2%. The front-loading of goods production and trade  \\nahead of the introduction of higher US tariff rates was an important source of support, with industrial  \\nproduction growth in the first half of the year exceeding the average pace of 2024 in most G20 economies.  \\nStrong investment growth in high technology sectors also boosted activity in the United States and Japan.  \\nNonetheless, private consumption growth has weakened in the United States, as well as in some euro  \\narea countries such as France and Italy. Many emerging-market economies had upside growth surprises  \\nbut in some cases this reflected idiosyncratic factors that are not expected to continue, including a first  \\nquarter spike in agriculture production in Brazil, and in the second quarter a steep fall in the growth of the  \\nGDP deflator in India, significant stockbuilding in T�rkiye, and a marked rebound in investment in  \\nIndonesia. In China, growth has held up, with a pick-up in the pace of government spending more than  \\noffsetting the dampening influence of the ongoing property market adjustment and headwinds to trade with  \\nthe United States.\\n\\nFINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES ⓒ OECD 2025'),\n",
